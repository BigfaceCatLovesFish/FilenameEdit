# FilenameEdit
it's Qt6.2 and windows11.

build.7z is runable package,the rest are source code.

sometimes it's annoying to manipulate filename,especially there is a lot files.
it's a simple filename edit app. enter the string u want to delete in the middle lineedit,clicked delete button,it'll detele the specified string included in the added files' name.
